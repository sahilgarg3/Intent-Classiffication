__ATIS__ dataset provides large number of messages and their associated intents that can be used in training a classifier. Within a chatbot, intent refers to the goal the customer has in mind when typing in a question or comment. While entity refers to the modifier the customer uses to describe their issue, the intent is what they really mean. Understanding the intent of the customer is key to implementing a successful chatbot experience for end-user.
